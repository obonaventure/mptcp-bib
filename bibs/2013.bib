abstract={Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has been proposed recently as a mechanism for transparently supporting multiple connections to the application layer. It is under discussion at the IETF. We nevertheless demonstrate that the current MPTCP suffers from two problems: P1) Upgrading some TCP users to MPTCP can reduce the throughput of others without any benefit to the upgraded users, which is a symptom of not being Pareto-optimal; and P2) MPTCP users could be excessively aggressive toward TCP users. We attribute these problems to the linked-increases algorithm (LIA) of MPTCP and, more specifically, to an excessive amount of traffic transmitted over congested paths. The design of LIA forces a tradeoff between optimal resource pooling and responsiveness. We revisit the problem and show that it is possible to provide these two properties simultaneously. We implement the resulting algorithm, called the opportunistic linked-increases algorithm (OLIA), in the Linux kernel, and we study its performance over our testbed by simulations and by theoretical analysis. We prove that OLIA is Pareto-optimal and satisfies the design goals of MPTCP. Hence, it can avoid the problems P1 and P2. Our measurements and simulations indicate that MPTCP with OLIA is as responsive and nonflappy as MPTCP with LIA and that it solves problems P1 and P2.},

abstract = "Hash-based load-balancing techniques are widely used to distribute the load over multiple forwarding paths and preserve the packet sequence of transport-level flows. Forcing a long-lived, i.e., elephant, flow to follow a specific path in the network is a desired mechanism in data center networks to avoid crossing hot spots. This limits the formation of bottlenecks and so improves the network use. Unfortunately, current per-flow load-balancing methods do not allow sources to deterministically force a specific path for a flow. In this paper, we propose a deterministic approach enabling end hosts to steer their flows over any desired load-balanced path without relying on any packet header extension. By using an invertible mechanism instead of solely relying on a hash function in routers, our method allows to easily select the packet’s header field values in order to force the selection of a given load-balanced path without storing any state in routers. We perform various simulations and experiments to evaluate the performance and prove the feasibility of our method using a Linux kernel implementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate with simulations and lab experiments how MultiPath \{TCP\} can benefit from the combination of our solution with a flow scheduling system that efficiently distributes elephant flows in large data center networks.
