abstract={With increasing deployment of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in multihoming and data enter scenarios, there is a need to understand how its performance is affected in practice-both by traditional factors such as RTT measurements, and by new multipath-specific considerations such as sub flow selection. We carried out an initial but comprehensive study using an actual MPTCP implementation in an emulated network environment, to explore the impact of different factors on MPTCP throughput. We find that path selection and packet scheduling have a large effect on performance, and that merely trusting the congestion control mechanism to do the right thing is not enough. Moreover, we provide evidence that throughput can be improved by slight modifications to the send buffers and path selection components of the implementation. Important challenges in network design remain, if only to ensure that multiple suitable paths exist in a network.},

abstract={Today, most of the smart phones are equipped with two network interfaces: Mobile Broadband (MBB) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Multi-path transport protocols provide increased throughput or reliability, by utilizing these interfaces simultaneously. However, multi-path transmission over networks with very different QoS characteristics is a challenge. In this paper, we studied Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) in heterogeneous networks, specifically MBB networks and WLAN. We first investigate the effect of bufferbloat in MBB on MPTCP performance. Then, we propose a bufferbloat mitigation algorithm: Multi-Path Transport Bufferbloat Mitigation (MPT-BM). Using our algorithm, we conduct experiments in real operational networks. The experimental results show that MPT-BM outperforms the current MPTCP implementation by increasing the application goodput quality and decreasing MPTCP's buffer delay, jitter and buffer space requirements.},

abstract={With the rapid deployment of cellular net-works, modern mobile devices are now equipped with at least two interfaces (WiFi and 3G/4G). As multi-path TCP (MPTCP) has been standardized by the IETF, mobile users running MPTCP can access the Internet via multiple interfaces simultaneously to provide robust data transport and better throughput. However, as cellular networks exhibit large RTTs compared to WiFi, for small data transfers, the delayed startup of additional flows in the current MPTCP design can limit the use of MPTCP. For large data transfers, when exploiting both the WiFi and cellular networks, the inflated and varying RTTs of the cellular flow together with the small and stable RTTs of the WiFi flow can lead to performance degradation. In this paper, we seek to investigate the causes of MPTCP performance issues in wireless environments and will provide analyses and a solution for better performance.},

Typically, these networks use L2 or L3 meshing mechanisms to route user traffic along a unique path out of the mesh. Their designs are driven by coverage and wireless capacity concerns, with wired backhaul links assumed to be high capacity. In this work we consider networks in which the wireless mesh links have comparable data-rates to the wired backhaul and ask how users can achieve high data-rates in practice. For these networks, we develop an opportunistic backhaul aggregation technique based on MPTCP and demonstrate it on Linux gateways.},

Nowadays, a large number of important services -- for instance e-commerce, healthcare and many others -- depend on the availability of the underlying network. Clearly, service interruptions due to network problems may have a severe impact. On the long way towards the Future Internet, the complexity will grow even further. Therefore, new ideas and concepts must be evaluated thoroughly, and particularly in realistic, real-world Internet scenarios, before they can be deployed for production networks. For this purpose, various testbeds -- for instance PlanetLab, GpENI or G-Lab -- have been established and are intensively used for research. However, all of these testbeds lack the support for so-called multi-homing.
Multi-homing denotes the connection of a site to multiple Internet service providers, in order to achieve redundancy. Clearly, with the need for network availability, there is a steadily growing demand for multi-homing. The idea of the NorNet Core project is to establish a Future Internet research testbed with multi-homed sites, in order to allow researchers to perform experiments with multi-homed systems. Particular use cases for this testbed include realistic experiments in the areas of multi-path routing, load balancing, multi-path transport protocols, overlay networks and network resilience. In this paper, we introduce the NorNet Core testbed as well as its architecture.}",

abstract={Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) promises to aggregate concurrent and multiple communications interfaces to improve data transmission rate. There is, however, an open issue of flow management under highly asymmetric condition where the throughput may degrade. This paper proposes an algorithm for flow scheduling in the sender to minimize the degree of out-of-order packets arriving in the receiver. The Round Trip Times (RTTs) of each path of a MPTCP connection are taken into traffic allocation over subflows. Simulations are conducted by extending the MPTCP open source modules for the NS2 tool set. It is found that the proposed algorithm is superior to a traditional Round-Robin (RR) technique in both buffer size and effective throughput.},

abstract={In this paper we report an investigation on potential session multipathing strategies that leverage the easy deployment of user space-based protocols. We devised an experimental session layer architecture to deal with multipathing and we implemented such architecture with 4 different libraries of asynchronous I/O processing for Linux systems: Epoll, Posix Threads, Posix AIO, and Libev. We discuss the evaluation of these implementations (a) by comparing them with the general kernel space solution, Multipath TCP (MPTCP), in an emulated network, and (b) by determining both the performance gain factor and the cost of resource consumption as function of the number of paths in a session. We found that Libev API, a full-featured and high-performance event loop, applied to the session multipathing enables an average good put gain factor of 1.62 faster per path added in a session, while its counterpart is of 2.23\% of CPU utilization per path and it requires no more than 4 MB of RAM regardless the number of paths. We also observed that Libev-based multipathing allows overall efficiency slightly higher than MPTCP.},

abstract={This paper introduces a cross-layer implementation, named WiPoMu, that aims to improve efficiency and resilience of the traditional WiFi model. WiPoMu is developed based on three key technologies: Wireless virtualization, Policy routing, and Multipath TCP (MPTCP). Specifically, WiPoMu adopts the wireless virtualization to create multiple virtual WiFi interfaces on a single physical one, hence WiPoMu enables concurrent connections with different access points (APs). In addition, WiPoMu leverages the policy routing and MPTCP in order to efficiently direct and schedule traffic flows over multiple virtual interfaces. On the other hand, WiPoMu is transparent to users since it requires no modification in the physical and application layers. We have conducted evaluations to validate the efficiency of WiPoMu on an indoor testbed and a real home network. The evaluation results show that a WiFi client equipped WiPoMu is able to establish multiple active paths to Internet across different APs. Besides that, WiPoMus is resilient to path failure by achieving seamless handover between the active paths. Furthermore, WiPoMu improves up to 300\% aggregated throughput comparing to the traditional WiFi model using TCP in the testbed.},

abstract={Since various types of wireless networks have been widely deployed, the Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) scheme over multiple wireless networks has become vital to ensure that current mobile users can gain advantage in the context of high data transmission throughput and communication robustness. Aiming at deploying the CMT scheme, in this paper, an implementation design of the CMT scheme based on the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with Android smartphones and protocol translation servers is presented. This scheme is based on a proxy technique that transparently translates the TCP flows into CMT-SCTP flows (streams) to avoid any changes to the existing service applications and legacy servers. The proposed scheme was preliminarily implemented and evaluated through a real-world experiment in Japan, and was shown to have considerable potential to achieve the above advantages.},

abstract={Evolution of use of wireless technologies in laptops and mobile terminals, which are equipped with several network interfaces, has provided users to take advantage from multi-homing to access network services anywhere, at any time and from any network. Advantage with multihomed host is that some of the traffic from more congested paths can be shifted to less congested path, thus controls congestion. In this paper we consider about Multipath TCP (MPTCP), which suffers from the degradation of goodput in the presence of changing network conditions on the available subflows due to out-of-order received packets. Cause of degradation is the large variation of end-to-end delay for multiple paths over wireless channels. To diminish the variation of end-to-end path delay, the proposed scheme uses congestion window adaption (CWA) algorithm to employ MPTCP source. Also to reduce the time of packet reordering at the receiver, a scheduling algorithm is employed for the MPTCP sender.},

abstract={The paper seeks to broaden our understanding of MPTCP and focuses on the impact that initial sub-path selection can have on performance. Using empirical data, it demonstrates that which sub-path is chosen to start an MPTCP connection can have unintuitive consequences. Using numerical analysis and a model-driven investigation, the paper elucidates and validates the empirical results, and highlights MPTCP's non-linear coupling between paths as a primary cause for this behavior. The findings are both of operational interest and may help design better MPTCP schedulers, as they are also exposed to complex interactions with MPTCP's congestion control.},
